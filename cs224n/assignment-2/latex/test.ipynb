    "Certainly! Based on the image you’ve provided, the first question seems to be about computing the derivative of the function ( h = \\text{ReLU}(xW + b_1) ) with respect to ( x ). Here’s how you can approach it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Definition: The ReLU function is defined as ( \\text{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z) ).\n",
    "Derivative Calculation: To find the derivative of ( h ) with respect to ( x ), you need to apply the chain rule.\n",
    "Chain Rule Application: If ( h = \\text{ReLU}(z) ) and ( z = xW + b_1 ), then ( \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} ).\n",
    "Considering ReLU’s Piecewise Nature: Since ReLU is a piecewise function, the derivative will be different depending on the value of ( z ):\n",
    "If ( z > 0 ), ( \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} = 1 ) and thus ( \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = W ).\n",
    "If ( z \\leq 0 ), ( \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} = 0 ) and thus ( \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = 0 ).\n",
    "For a specific index ( i ) and ( j ), assuming ( z > 0 ), the derivative ( \\frac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial x_j} ) would be the element ( W_{ij} ) from the weight matrix ( W ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to consider the case where ( z ) is not greater than zero, in which case the derivative would be zero. If you need further assistance with the math or any other questions, feel free to ask!"
